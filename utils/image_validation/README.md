# Image validation

Crate providing methods for validating properties of images, such as whether the image is blurry,
whether it contains a sufficient variation of colors, whether it is too dark or too bright, etc.

We employ such validation to, among several other cases, ensure that the images we collect for the
specimens and samples are indeed of good quality.
