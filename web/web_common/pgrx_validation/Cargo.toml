# Commented out to avoid building a shared library for the generic compilation targets,
# and unfortunately it is not possible (to my knowledge) to conditionally set the crate-type
# based on the target or features in Cargo.toml. Therefore, there is in this directory instead
# a DockerCargo.toml file that is used to build the shared library for the pgrx validation
# library in the Docker container.
