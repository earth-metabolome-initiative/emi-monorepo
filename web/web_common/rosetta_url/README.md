# Rosetta URL

Crate to provide a standardized type for URLs based on [`rust-url`](https://github.com/servo/rust-url), with optional implementation of the [`diesel`](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/blob/master/guide_drafts/custom_types.md) traits for the `SQLite` and `PostgreSQL` backends with integration with [`pgrx`](https://github.com/pgcentralfoundation/pgrx).
