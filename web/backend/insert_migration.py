"""Insert a migration with the given name at the specified counter.

Implementative details
----------------------
This script will insert a migration with the given name at the specified counter. It will
first revert all of the migrations with a counter greater than or equal to the specified
counter, then increase the counter of all migrations with a counter greater than or equal
to the specified counter, and finally create a new migration with the specified name at the
specified counter.

The migrations must have names of the form "00000000000045_some_name", where the number is
the counter. The script will automatically pad the counter with zeroes to the appropriate
length.
