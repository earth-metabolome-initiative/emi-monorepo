# CSQLV

The CSQLV crate allows to easily integrate CSVs files (and also TSVs and SSVs) into your PostgreSQL database.

The crate will generate the necessary SQL to create the tables and relationships between them based on the CSVs files found in a given directory, with minimal metadata in the CSVs themselves. The types and their constraints are inferred from the data in the CSVs: for instance, if all the values in a column are integers smaller than 32767, the crate will infer that the column should be of type `SMALLINT`. Similarly, if no value in a column is empty, the crate will infer that the column should be `NOT NULL`. Same thing applies to `UNIQUE` constraints: if all the values in a column are unique, the crate will infer that the column should be `UNIQUE`.

Integer columns characterized by a sequence of continuos integers starting from 1 will be inferred as `SERIAL` columns, which will automatically generate a sequence and a default value for the column. The crate will automatically determine and dispatch the smallest `SERIAL` type that can hold the values in the column (e.g., `SMALLSERIAL`, `SERIAL`, `BIGSERIAL`).

The documents may also be compressed with `gzip`, in which case the crate will generate the necessary SQL to decompress them before loading them into the database.

## Installation

As usual, add the following line to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
csqlv = "0.1"
```

## Usage

Given a directory containing CSV files, such as `./tests/bands`, you can create the SQL necessary to define the tables and relationships between them as follows:

```rust
use csqlv::{CSVSchemaBuilder, CSVSchema};

let schema: CSVSchema = CSVSchemaBuilder::default()
    // To show a loading bar while processing the CSVs
    .verbose()
    // To include compressed files such as .gz
    .include_gz()
    // For supporting running the tests within
    // containers such as Docker
    .singularize()
    .container_directory("/app/bands")
    .from_dir("./tests/bands")
    .unwrap();

let sql: String = schema.to_postgres().unwrap();

println!("{}", sql);
```

See below a detailed breakdown of the syntax used in the CSVs used in the example above.

## Syntax of the CSV files

If I have a table called `players` with a column `name` and a table called `bands` with a column `name`, I may want to define their relationships via a third table called `band_members` as follows:

So, if I have a SSV file called `players.ssv` with the following content:

| name  | age |
|-------|-----|
| Paul  | 20  |
| John  | 30  |
| Ringo | 25  |
| Kurt  | 27  |

And a CSV file called `bands.csv` with the following content:

| band        | foundation_year | founded_by:players.name |
|-------------|-----------------|-------------------------|
| The Beatles | 1960            | Paul                    |
| Nirvana     | 1987            | Kurt                    |

I can define the relationships between the tables in the GZIP-compressed TSV file `band_members.tsv.gz` as follows:

| bands.band  | players.name |
|-------------|--------------|
| The Beatles | Paul         |
| The Beatles | John         |
| The Beatles | Ringo        |
| Nirvana     | Kurt         |

This will generate SQL defining the following tables:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS players (
    name TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    age SMALLINT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    id SMALLSERIAL PRIMARY KEY UNIQUE NOT NULL
);
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE players_temp (
    name TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    age SMALLINT UNIQUE NOT NULL
);

COPY players_temp FROM '/app/csvs/bands/players.ssv' DELIMITER ' ' CSV HEADER;

INSERT INTO players (
    name,
    age
) SELECT
    players_temp.name,
    players_temp.age
FROM
    players_temp;

DROP TABLE players_temp;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS bands (
    band TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    foundation_year SMALLINT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    founded_by SMALLINT UNIQUE NOT NULL REFERENCES players(id),
    id SMALLSERIAL PRIMARY KEY UNIQUE NOT NULL
);
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE bands_temp (
    band TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    foundation_year SMALLINT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    players_name VARCHAR(4)
);

COPY bands_temp FROM '/app/csvs/bands/bands.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;

INSERT INTO bands (
    band,
    foundation_year,
    founded_by
) SELECT
    bands_temp.band,
    bands_temp.foundation_year,
    players.id
FROM
    bands_temp
    JOIN players ON bands_temp.players_name = players.name;

DROP TABLE bands_temp;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS band_members (
    band_id SMALLINT NOT NULL REFERENCES bands(id),
    player_id SMALLINT UNIQUE NOT NULL REFERENCES players(id),
    id SMALLSERIAL PRIMARY KEY UNIQUE NOT NULL
);
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE band_members_temp (
    bands_band TEXT,
    players_name TEXT
);

COPY band_members_temp FROM PROGRAM 'gzip -dc /app/csvs/bands/band_members.tsv.gz' DELIMITER '  ' CSV HEADER;

INSERT INTO band_members (
    band_id,
    player_id
) SELECT
    bands.id,
    players.id
FROM
    band_members_temp
    JOIN bands ON band_members_temp.bands_band = bands.band
    JOIN players ON band_members_temp.players_name = players.name;

DROP TABLE band_members_temp;
```
